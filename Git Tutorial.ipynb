      "# Version Control with Git\n",
      "\n",
      "Version control is a way of tracking the change history of a project. Even if you have never used a version control tool, you've probably already done it manually: copying and renaming project folders (\"paper-1.doc\", \"paper-2.doc\", etc.) is a form of version control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Git is a tool that automates and enhances a lot of the tasks that arise when dealing with larger, longer-living, and collaborative projects. It's also become the common underpinning to many popular online code repositories, [GitHub](https://github.com/) being the most popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll go over the basics of git, but I should point out that a *lot* of talented people have given git tutorials, and I won't do any better than they have. In fact, if you're interested in learning git deeply and have some time on your hands, I suggest you stop reading this and instead read [the Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Scott Chacon and Ben Straub have done a tremendous job, and if you want to understand both the interfaces and the mechanisms behind git, this is the place to start."

      "If you ask 10 people, you'll get 10 different answers, but one of the commonalities is that most people don't realize how integral it is to their development process until they've started using it. Still, for the sake of argument, here are some highlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ** You can undo anything: ** Git provides a complete history of every change that has ever been made to your project, timestamped, commented, and attributed. If something breaks, you always have the choice of going back to a previous state.\n",
      "- ** You won't *need* to keep undo-ing things: ** One of the advantages of using git properly is that by keeping new changes separate from a stable base, you tend to avoid the massive rollbacks associated with constantly tinkering with a single code.\n",
      "- ** You can identify exactly when and where changes were made: ** Git allows you to pinpoint when a particular piece of code was changed, so finding what other pieces of code a bug might affect or figuring out why a certain expression was added is easy.\n",
      "- ** Git forces teams to face conflicts directly: ** On a team-based project, many people are often working with the same code. By having a tool which understands when and where files were changed, it's easy to see when changes might conflict with each other. While it might seem troublesome sometimes to have to deal with conflicts, the alternative&mdash;*not* knowing there's a conflict&mdash;is much more insidious."

      "The first thing to understand about git is that the contents of your project are stored in several different states and forms at any given time. If you think about what version control is, this might not be surprising: in order to remember every change that's ever been made, you need to store a record of those changes *somewhere*, and to be able to handle multiple people changing the same code, you need to have different copies of the project and a way to combine them.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can think about git operating on four different areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src='git_commands/git_layout.png' style=\"width:400px; display:inline-block;\">\n",
      "\n",
      " - The **working directory** is what you're currently looking at. When you use an editor to modify a file, the changes are made to the working directory.\n",
      " - The **staging area** is a place to collect a set of changes made to your project. If you have changed three files to fix a bug, you will add all three to the staging area so that you can remember the changes as one historical entity.\n",
      " - The **local repository** is the place where git stores everything you've ever done to your project. Even when you delete a file, a copy is stored in the repo (this is necessary for always being able to undo any change). It's important to note that a local repository doesn't look much at all like your project files or directories. Git has its own way of storing all the information, and if you're curious what it looks like, look in the `.git` directory in the working directory of your project.\n",
      " - When working in a team, every member will be working on their own local repository. An **upstream repository** allows everyone to agree on a single version of history. If two people have made changes on their local repositories, they will combine those changes in the upstream repository.\n",

One solution would be to simply use the more recent change, but this very easily leads to self-inconsistent programs. A more conservative solution, and the one git uses, is to simply leave the decision to the user. When git detects a conflict that it cannot resolve, `merge` fails, and git places a modified version of the offending file in your project directory. **This is important:** the file that git puts into your directory is not actually *either* of the originals.

Pull requests are a way to incorporate changes from other people *without* giving them full write access to your repository. They can also be a reasonable way to conduct code reviews before pushing code to a production branch.\n",
